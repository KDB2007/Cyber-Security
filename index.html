            <p>Cybersecurity is the protection of internet-connected systems such as hardware, software and data from
                cyberthreats. The practice is used by individuals and enterprises to protect against unauthorized access
                to data centers and other computerized systems.</p>

            <h1>About Cyber Security</h1>
            <p>Computer security, cybersecurity (cyber security), or information technology security (IT security) is
                the protection of computer systems and networks from information disclosure, theft of, or damage to
                their hardware, software, or electronic data, as well as from the disruption or misdirection of the
                services they provide.[1]

                The field has become significant due to the expanded reliance on computer systems, the Internet,[2] and
                wireless network standards such as Bluetooth and Wi-Fi, and due to the growth of "smart" devices,
                including smartphones, televisions, and the various devices that constitute the Internet of things
                (IoT). Cybersecurity is also one of the significant challenges in the contemporary world, due to its
                complexity, both in terms of political usage and technology. Its primary goal is to ensure the system's
                dependability, integrity, and data privacy.</p>
